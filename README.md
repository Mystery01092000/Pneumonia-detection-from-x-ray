# Pneumonia Diagnosis Using Deep Learning

## Introduction
The problem of proper diagnosis of disease is an essential need of today's world. One of the major issues that medical professionals face is the correct diagnosis of conditions and diseases of patients. Not being able to correctly diagnose a condition is a problem for both the patient and the doctor. Misdiagnosis could lead to malpractice lawsuits and overall hurt the doctor's business. The patient suffers by not receiving the proper treatement and risking greater harm to health by the condition that goes undetected; further the patient undergoes neccessary treatement and takes unnecessary medications, costing the patient time and money.

It happens in many cases that with bare eyes or by doctors sometimes reading the disease goes undetected. This can cause a lot. With the help of machine learning we can look at this problem and solve it more efficiently. 

Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it.

The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe. Also, Pneumonia is a contagious disease which can spread from person to person. I worst cases it can harm many lives if not treated on time.


In this project, we will apply machine learning and in particular Deep Learning to a dataset containing x-ray report of patients treated under an orgranization.

In this study, I will apply Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and try to classify a patient as either having pneumonia or not having pneumonia. This problem lies in binary classification.

(Also, as we are concerned about the type of pneumonia as the patient either have Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia or no pneumonia. So, we will consider it as a 3 class clissification problem.)
